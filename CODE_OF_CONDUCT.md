# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background or identity. This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and synchronous communication.

## Standards
- Be respectful and assume good intent; disagree with ideas, not people.
- Offer constructive feedback with clear reasoning and examples.
- Keep discussions inclusive—avoid personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory language.
- Protect user data and private keys; never post sensitive information.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, threats, stalking, or doxxing.
- Sustained disruption, trolling, or intentionally derailing conversations.
- Sharing sensitive data (e.g., user content, API keys) without consent.

## Reporting
- Prefer private channels for reporting: GitHub Security Advisory (for security issues). If that is unavailable, open an issue with minimal details and request a secure follow-up.
- Reports will be acknowledged within 5 business days. We aim to provide a resolution path or status update within 14 business days.

## Enforcement
- Maintainers may remove content, issue warnings, or restrict participation when behavior violates this code.
- Repeated or severe violations may lead to bans from the project.

## 中文简述
- 尊重、友善、包容，讨论聚焦问题本身；避免人身攻击、歧视或泄露敏感信息。  
- 违规行为（骚扰、仇恨言论、威胁、泄密等）将被删除并可能导致禁言/移除。  
- 如需举报，请优先通过私密渠道（安全通告）；如无法使用，可提交 Issue（简要描述）并请求私下跟进。
