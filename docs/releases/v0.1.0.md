# Release Notes – v0.1.0 (2026-01-15)

## Highlights
- Full workflow: upload → analysis → translation → proofreading → export (HTML/PDF, optional EPUB).
- Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) with prompt templates and reference matching.
- Web UI (React/Vite) for per-paragraph editing, locking, and re-translation.
- New ops tooling: CI for backend pytest + frontend lint/build, quality gates, SBOM artifact; CodeQL; Dependabot.
- Compliance/privacy docs and release/deployment guides.

## Upgrade notes
- Enable auth for any networked deployment: set `API_AUTH_TOKEN` and `REQUIRE_AUTH_ALL=true` in `backend/.env`.
- If you used the old `PORT=5300`/`VITE_PORT=5200` convention, update your `.env` or compose overrides accordingly.
- Clean local data before tagging: remove `projects/*`, `data/temp/`, `backend/epub_translator.db`, and `epub_sample/`.

## Installation
```bash
./start.sh                # local dev (auto installs deps)
```

## Known issues / follow-ups
- Test coverage is minimal; add backend pytest suites and frontend MSW/RTL/Playwright E2E for gating and workflows.
- No production log/metrics stack is wired; add Sentry/OTel as needed.
- Dependency locks: Python still uses floating `requirements.txt`; consider pip-tools/uv pinning for reproducible builds.
